# BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES

### What is MapReduce? 
* The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform. 
* The first is the map job, which takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value pairs).
* The reduce job takes the output from a map as input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples. As the sequence of the name MapReduce implies, the reduce job is always performed after the map job. ðŸ‘‰ [from here](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/mapreduce)
* The whole process goes through four phases of execution namely, splitting, mapping, shuffling, and reducing ðŸ‘‰ [from here](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-mapreduce.html)
